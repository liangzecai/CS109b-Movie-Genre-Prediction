Q. what's next? (by Monday?)

for Wenshan:
1. add to it the TMDB variables we want to keep
2. delete variables of different versions of title
3. merge "genres" from IMDB and TMDB
4. turn genres to one-hot coding
(we don't need to parse by loop, see the code in "MS2_dummy coding.ipynb" )
5. generate two files:
"data_25k_feature.txt"
"data_25k_genres.txt" (already turned into one-hot coding)

6. also, generate the corrorelation matrix for different genres using the 25k data (we cae use this as the filter to group different genres)

for Danqing:
1. you can start looking into variables: 'director', 'distributors', 'producer', 'writer', 'production companies', 
               'cinematographer', 'cast', 'animation department', 'original music'
2. you don't need to parse again for again, see the code in "MS2_dummy coding.ipynb", which can turn the string into dummy variables
3. do PCA and return data frames called df_director where each column is called "director_pc1"
4.  also record the number of the items ('director' for example) for each movie (add the row for dummy matrix) and form a variable called "director_number"

for Zecai:
similar as Danqing, do text analysis on "title","plot outline", "plot", "mpaa_reason", "tagline_TMDB"

--------------------------------------
after forming our final data:
baseline classifier:
- SVM
- random forest
- grouped genre
