3. How do we differentiate between movies and TV etc?

4. How much do the two databases agree on genres? 
e.g. one database may classify something as "drama" and "thriller", anoter might classify the same movie as "drama" and "horror". 
How do we treat movie labels when we encounter different genre labels?
