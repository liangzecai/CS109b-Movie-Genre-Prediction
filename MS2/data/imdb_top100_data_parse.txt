One of those is Freder Fredersen. One day, he spots a beautiful woman with a group of children, she and the children who quickly disappear. Trying to follow her, he, oblivious to such, is horrified to find an underground world of workers, apparently who run the machinery which keeps the above ground Utopian world functioning. One of the few people above ground who knows about the world below is Freder\'s father, Joh Fredersen, who is the founder and master of Metropolis. Freder learns that the woman is Maria, who espouses the need to join the ""hands"" - the workers - to the ""head"" - those in power above - by a mediator or the ""heart"". Freder wants to help the plight of the workers in the want for a better life. But when Joh learns of what Maria is espousing and that Freder is joining their cause, Joh, with the assistance of an old colleague and now nemesis named Rotwang, an inventor, works toward quashing a supposed uprising, with Maria as the center of their plan. However, Joh is unaware that Rotwang has his own agenda. But if any of these plans includes the shut down of the machines, total anarchy could break loose both above ground and below.', u'In the future, the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes: the workers, who live in the underground below the machines level, and the dominant classes that lives in the surface. The workers are controlled by their leader Maria, who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers, since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles. Maria meets Freder Fredersen, the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen, in a meeting of the workers, and they fall in love for each other. Meanwhile, Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis, and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate them.', u'The future. Metropolis is a wonderful city, high above the ground its towers stand. The people prosper, the economy is flourishing, the suspended streets are busy. But Metropolis also has a great secret, so hidden that not even Freder Fredersen, son of founder Joh Fredersen knows about it. He is spending his free time in the Eternal Gardens, when suddenly a woman shows up, with what looks like a class of children. They\'re from the City of Workers, in the depth, Freder learns. ""These are your brothers"", she tells the children, before she is forced to leave. Freder is so intrigued he follows them into the depth and doesn\'t like what he sees. The workers are exploited, they must do labor like robots. Freder tries to convince his father to change, while the woman tries to keep workers\' morale high by predicting a man will stand up that will mediate. Someone that will use both hands and head, someone that will be the heart.', u""In a futuristic city sharply divided between the working class and the city planners, the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a working class prophet who predicts the coming of a savior to mediate their differences.""]","['0002154', '0297054', '0459030', '0003248', '0519765', '0084430', '0313447', '0375609', '0016641', '0074186', '0091178', '0226376', '0294558', '0307319', '0331796', '0340553', '0386046', '0313308', '0473864', '0486938', '0509038', '0716938', '0718094', '0802561', '1032742', '0832605', '0890911', '0902327', '0902740', '0917832', '0937473']",,"['0403288', '0466851', '0002380', '0651729', '0776169', '2307111', '0923118']",Metropolis,"['6258563', '8357205']",Metropolis,Metropolis (1927),Metropolis (1927),Metropolis,Metropolis (1927),https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAzNTkyODg1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3NDkwMDE@.jpg,17136,

The only life the Elliots have known is working in the mine. Current family patriarch, widowed Jackie Elliot, and his eldest son Tony Elliot work in the mine, and Jackie's younger son, eleven year old Billy Elliot, will probably take his place alongside his father and brother when the time comes. However, Jackie, Tony and their fellow miners are currently in a bitter labor dispute, with the mine still operating with scab labor, which is prolonging the strike since the company has no reason to give in to the wage demands. With the strike foremost on Jackie and Tony's minds, Billy is left largely to his own devices, his father giving him 50p for the community boxing class down at the boys' club when Billy is not at home looking after his gram, who has early onset Alzheimer's. Learning how to box is another of the activities passed down along the male lineage of the Elliot family. However, Billy doesn't much like it and isn't very good at it, instead more interested in the movement put to music in the form of the girls' ballet class held on the other side of the gym by chain-smoking Mrs. Wilkinson. Soon, Billy has ditched the boxing, instead secretly attending the ballet class with Mrs. Wilkinson's blessing. She can see that Billy not only has natural talent but passion, unlike most of the girls in the class, so much so that she believes he may have a real shot at making it into the Royal Ballet School. However, Billy has to decide whether this path is one he wants to take, especially as it means coming clean to his family, Jackie and Tony who may feel emasculated in the process, especially if their miner friends find out, and especially in Billy's destiny as a coal miner himself. Billy's involvement in the ballet may tear the family apart in ways he didn't even imagine.

Eleven-year old Billy Elliot, whose father and brother are participating in the strike, whose mother has died quite some time ago and whose grandmother is not completely aware of what's going on, doesn't like the brutal boxing lessons at school. Instead, he falls for the girls' ballet lessons. When his folks find out about this unusual love of his, Billy is in trouble.

They include midgets, limbless people, pinheads, conjoined twins, a bearded lady, and a half man/half woman. There are many interpersonal interactions between the entire troupe, those interactions which are generally amiable, although there are some who treat the curiosities merely as freaks. However, there are few romantic relationships between the ""normal"" troupe members and the curiosities. One of those exceptions is the budding romantic relationship between Hans and Cleopatra, one of the midgets and a trapeze artist respectively. What Hans is unaware of is that Cleopatra only fosters that relationship because of the expensive gifts he lavishes on her, while in reality she carries on with who is probably the antithesis of Hans physically, Hercules, the muscle man. A fellow midget, Frieda, who was once engaged to Hans and who she still loves, believes Cleopatra\'s interest in Hans is solely to make fun.

But he has the most disdain for Groundhog Day held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, which he is to cover for the fourth time in his career, this year with Rita and Larry, the station\'s new producer and cameraman respectively. Phil wants to get in and out of Punxsutawney as quickly as possible, but a snowstorm forces the threesome to stay an extra night in town after the Groundhog Day festivities. When Phil awakens the next morning, he is experiencing what he thinks is d\xe9j\xe0 vu. In reality, he is experiencing that Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney all over again.

Reuben Tishkoff, who lost a casino to Benedict, provides funding, the brothers Virgil and Turk Malloy will drive and help, and Frank Catton, a professional card dealer, gets a job at the casino to watch the routines. Saul Bloom, already retired, will play the rich heavy weaponry dealer and live in the hotel, while Livingston Dell bugs the place to have a look over the shoulders of the security personnel. Finally, the chinese acrobat artist Yen will be the one to move inside the safe before the motion detectors are turned off. There are three rules to be followed: First: no blood. Second: Rob only who deserves it. Third: Do it as if you have nothing to lose.

No sooner does he violate his parole that he's traveling around the country gathering people for his next big scheme: to rob three casinos owned by the ever ruthless Terry Benedict. With the aid of a right hand man named Rusty, a thief out of retirement, a pickpocket, a card dealer, a surveillance man, a Chinese acrobat, an explosives expert, two frontmen, and a bitter casino mogul, they make up Ocean's eleven, out to make one very big score."", u""Danny Ocean is a thief who has just been paroled from prison.

So they recruit nine guys and they begin to put Ocean's plan in motion. Everything is going well until Rusty discovers that Ocean's ex-wife, Tess is the main squeeze of Terry Benedict the (ruthless) owner of the casinos. Rusty asks him what is he going to do if he has to choose. But Ocean says that if his plan goes smoothly, he is going to be able to have his cake and eat it."", u'Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously.']","['0000123', '0083781', '0634342', '0282665', '1131138', '0005170', '0000093', '0304629', '0673633', '0001285', '0666564', '0000729', '0004790', '0420646', '1130942', '0810909', '0702296', '0702660', '0005348', '0507459', '0459890', '0000354', '1130873', '7281486', '0676649', '0003861', '1129541', '1130661', '0478534', '0000412', '1533518', '1130972', '0216399', '1130169', '1130848', '1130630', '0000210', '0755179', '0002262', '0005545', '0021439', '1129773', '0798328', '0331171', '0001141', '0493031', '0628611', '0278788', '0746913', '0483915', '0580341', '0715644', '1278272', '0694569', '0021411', '0583620', '0185377', '0777435', '3048570', '0733421', '1027309', '1129628', '0019166', '4183698', '0056129', '4079164', '3239688', '1010812', '2729064', '1019707', '0000332', '0001061', '3996395', '1249529', '0242617', '0243695', '3592202', '0298398', '4313392', '4547822', '0333410', '1009093', '0355155', '0005045', '1693977', '2466111', '2779416', '0500610', '2686278', '1104232', '2925647', '0551997', '1062656', '0586616', '1459773', '0672575', '0673505', '0683217', '0687184', '0733162', '1123216', '0740951', '0776963', '0001752', '0961765', '3591773', '1742525', '0865325', '0005538', '0922342', '0950878']",,['0391794'],Ocean's Eleven,"['0187954', '1054553', '0743327', '0767098', '0849907', '0908079', '1014650', '3238835']",Ocean's Eleven,Ocean's Eleven (2001),Ocean's Eleven (2001),Ocean's Eleven,Ocean's Eleven (2001),https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzVmYzVkMmUtOGRhMi00MTNmLThlMmUtZTljYjlkMjNkMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@.jpg,240772,some language and sexual content

They use three gifted humans (called ""Pre-Cogs"") with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system\'s flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn\'t even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery\'s core by finding out the \'minority report\' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that ""might"" tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.', u'In Washington, D.C., in the year 2054, murder has been eliminated. The future is seen and the guilty punished before the crime has ever been committed. From a nexus deep within the Justice Department\'s elite Pre-Crime unit, all the evidence to convict--from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details--is seen by ""Pre-Cogs,"" three psychic beings whose visions of murders have never been wrong. It is the nation\'s most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no one works harder for Pre-Crime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fueled his conviction that Pre-Crime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it until he becomes its #1 suspect. As the head of the unit, Anderton is the first to see the images as they flow from the liquid suspension chamber where the Pre-Cogs dream of murder. The faces are unknown to him, but this time, the killer\'s identity is clear when Anderton will murder a total stranger in less than 36 hours. Now with his own unit tracking his every move, led by his rival Danny Witwer, Anderton must go below the radar of the state-of-the-art automated city, where every step you take is monitored. Because people can\'t hide, everybody runs. With no way to defend himself against the charge of Pre-Crime, John must trace the roots of what brought him here, and uncover the truth behind the questions he has spent the past six years working to eliminate: Is it possible for the Pre-Cogs to be wrong?', u'Based off of a short story. It is the near future, a future where murders have become so common, that a system had to be established. This system is called ""Precrime"", where 3 psychics can predict murders before they happen. Allowing police to stop the murders. This system is in production in Washington D.C. Where police officer John Anderton (who lost his son to a murder 6 years previous) has stopped numerous murders in his career. One day, he found out that he is the next person to commit a murder. Now, he is running away from a system he helped become successful, and trying to find out why he was set up to commit murder.', u'In the year 2054, a so-called ""pre-crime division"" is working around Washington, DC. Its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating connected in a tank of fluid, have a vision, the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time it will happen, are given out to the special cops who then try to prevent the crime from happening. But there is a political dilemma: If someone is arrested before he commits a murder, can the person be accused of the murder, which - because of the arrest - never took place? The project of pre-crime, at the time being in a state of trial run, is going to be voted about in the near future. If people accept it, the crime rate is going to drop drastically, but it never will be known if there might not be too many people imprisoned, some or even all of them innocent. After John Anderton lost his son to a crime a six years ago, he took up drugs, and works the precog division like nobody else. One day, his own name arrives in the ""perpetrator"" chute, and the precogs predict that he will kill a man he never knew in less than 36 hours. John takes off, his trust in the system diminishing rapidly. His own colleagues after him, John follows a very small trace that might hold the key to his innocence, a strange unsolved yet predicted murder and a so-called ""minority report"", a documentation of one of the rare events in which a precog sees something different than the other two.', u'It is the year 2054 - Washington D.C. - dreams can be recreated through computers, computer monitors and displays are transformed into holograms, and identification is done through eye-scanning. John Anderton lost his son, and to prevent horrible events from occurring to other individuals he joins a unit known as ""Pre-Crime"" - where murderers are arrested before they can commit the murder. How does Pre-Crime work? Through 3 people known as ""precogs"". They are 3 psychics used to see the future and they see murders exactly the way they will occur. Through advanced technology, Pre-Crime officers are able to see what the precogs see, and they analyze the data, identify the perpetrator and victim, and try their best to stop the murder from occurring. The perpetrator is put into a sleep state with a device called a ""halo"". John Anderton gets accused of murdering a man he has never even met, causing him to run from Pre-Crime and prove his innocence.', u'In a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit is himself accused of a future murder.']","['0000129', '0001884', '0004996', '0568180', '0453304', '0004800', '0168044', '0132625', '0938570', '0779455', '0342029', '0395428', '0799890', '0652090', '1012810', '0033871', '1173984', '0282436', '1177924', '0418446', '0517792', '0808122', '0445556', '0711110', '0268199', '0709078', '1059827', '0925862', '0608121', '0608090', '0518687', '0225575', '1179525', '0809135', '0625789', '0908647', '0753246', '0606700', '1090133', '1122614', '0343325', '0189524', '0082802', '0340408', '0363888', '1178766', '0031529', '0581943', '0291082', '1179437', '0874350', '0529011', '0500777', '1178170', '0060873', '0001780', '0481222', '1144368', '1178307', '0102060', '1178674', '1179765', '1178675', '1178537', '1178676', '0354902', '0731473', '0086515', '1179025', '0706838', '0153108', '1178157', '1179694', '0384739', '1178277', '0544611', '1179563', '0761955', '0604507', '0178626', '0704088', '0646925', '0923823', '0412400', '0830125', '0777993', '1179821', '1178918', '0071838', '0242687', '0880726', '0003942', '0234606', '0302704', '0395196', '1022440', '0005243', '1178940', '0641418', '0657903', '0668316', '1183182', '1181518', '1181096', '0038418', '1347896', '0018605', '0000759', '0042367', '2220002', '3835190', '3425823', '0146268', '8641952', '0001081', '2246893', '1169709', '0000139', '1725818', '0794728', '1835188', '0283239', '0147361', '1035461', '2050882', '1420432', '1339144', '1767162', '0434243', '1693977', '1759118', '0443518', '5141688', '1024757', '2032285', '1824972', '1042162', '0599019', '3269395', '1394483', '2035230', '0728284', '0732187', '1242186', '1074374', '0791851', '1186258', '1828323', '4496320', '2313879', '1124747', '0856042', '1056309', '0913587']",,['0002354'],Minority Report,"['0123163', '0125693', '0169591', '0186410', '0191216', '0265219', '1181294', '0334391', '0342259', '0872160', '0958665', '1148516', '2207965', '1398371', '0782535']",Minority Report,Minority Report (2002),Minority Report (2002),Minority Report,Minority Report (2002),https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDgzNDk3ZDctYTUxMC00MDQzLWI1MTctMmQxYWE0MGUzYzIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@.jpg,181689,"violence, brief language, some sexuality and drug content"

He heads to the Blue Angel himself to catch the boys in the act and shame them into not going again. Over several visits, Rath is able to catch the boys, but in the process he also understands what attracts the boys, namely the headlining performer Lola Lola.

Recuperating at home with his new wife Elizabeth, Henry is visited by Dr. Pretorius, a disgraced former colleague.

What Pretorius' end goal is to create a woman so that Frankenstein's monster and this woman can procreate to form a new race. Even if he is able to pressure Henry into working with him, they have a few obstacles. The first is that the monster has escaped, with the authorities and vigilantes out to destroy him. The second is that the longer the monster is out in the world, the more he will be experiencing and learning, including from those equally marginalized, giving him a mind of his own. And third, of what Pretorius and Henry may be unaware, the monster and their new female creation being human may provide them with human attributes which factor into human coupling in its natural state."", u'Mary Shelley, author of ""Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus,"" reveals to Percy Shelley and Lord Byron that Henry Frankenstein and his Monster did not die.

After learning of the general location of the body of a local boy who has been missing for several days, they set off into woods to see it. Along the way, they learn about themselves, the meaning of friendship and the need to stand up for what is right."", u""Upon reading of the death of one of his childhood friends, late thirty-something Gordie Lachance remembers back to an incident when he was twelve involving that friend. His story... It's just before the Labor Day weekend 1959 in his hometown of Castle Rock, Oregon, just before he is about to enter junior high. He, an insecure young man, feels more invisible at home than usual as it's five months after the tragic death of his older brother Denny, the favored son, who he loved and misses as much as anyone. His parents, who just don't understand Gordie's love of storytelling and writing as opposed to Denny's athletic pursuits, still have not gotten over their grief. Gordie spends much time with his three closest same aged friends, who attend school together. Vern Tessio is the slightly dim overweight one, that dimness largely out of naivety. Teddy Duchamp is the crazy one, whose father is also crazy albeit violently, even against Teddy. And Chris Chambers, Gordie's best friend, has in the public mindset a predetermined future as a lowlife, being just the latest lowlife in the Chambers family. Regardless, Chris acts more as a responsible father figure to Gordie in many ways than Gordie's own father. Vern learns from secretly overhearing his older delinquent brother Billy's conversation that he has discovered a dead body in the woods about twenty or thirty miles away, but does not want to do anything about it or tell anyone, especially in authority. With Vern telling his three friends, the four believe it is probably Ray Brower, a boy around their age from another town who went missing three days ago while going blueberry picking. Needing to walk there, they decide to go retrieve the body and thus become heroes in the process. They devise a plan of attack that will give them about twenty-four hours before their respective families may even realize that they are gone. What the four don't realize is that Billy does eventually tell his group of friends, led by the sadistic Ace Merrill, who has a win at any cost mentality, and as such it becomes a race to retrieve the body. But in their physical journey, the four boys also go through an emotional journey about their lives, their friendship and for Gordie why he has what becomes an obsession to see that dead body."", u'As a man writes about an adventure to find a dead body as a 12 year boy, he realizes that he will never have as good as friends as he did when he was younger, does anyone?

First, the more brazen Joe falls for one of the other band members, ukulele player and vocalist Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, although Jerry too is attracted to her. Joe does whatever he can to find time to get out of drag to woo Sugar while in Miami, using all the knowledge Josephine gleans directly from Sugar about what turns her crank in potential husband material.
