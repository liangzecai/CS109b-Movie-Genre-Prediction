Q.  What's next for deep learning on posters?
Do we use pre-trained model? Or train our hand-built CNN? Should we fine-tune to what extend?

Q. Text analysis (plot, plot-outline, mpaa_reason, tagline, overview)
tf-idf gives too long a vector;
PCA (even the firs 20 PCs) retrives little variance;
what we try deep laerning? than what structure of the neural network (MLP)?

Q. how to incoroprate poster data (deep learning results) with the classical ML results?
- One idea we have is to take the probabilities for each class (8 classes in total) generated by the each of the models, combine them into a 16-column dataframe, and train a model on this new dataframe for weights. 
- Alternatively, we can compare the performance between the two methods without combining the two. 

Q. instructions on final report? what to report? focus? format? number of figures? 

Q. instrucitons on video? powerpoint to present main results or just jupyter notebook?
