tf-idf gives too long a vector;
PCA (even the firs 20 PCs) retrives little variance;
what we try deep laerning? than what structure of the neural network (MLP)?

Q. how to incoroprate poster data (deep learning results) with the classical ML results?

Q. instructions on final report? what to report? focus?
