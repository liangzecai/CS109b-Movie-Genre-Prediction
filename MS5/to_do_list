WORKFLOW 
Paper
1. Data preparation (one page) (## Wenshan) 
  - Describe how we obtained data (Imdb, Tmdb), and why did we choose to work with 5000 data.
  - Describe data cleaning process, how we combine the two databases, reconcile differences
  - Data exploration, corr matirx (fig), histogram with grouped genre (fig), why we chose 8 genres 

2. Classical machine learning (two pages)
  - feature engineering:
      - numerial meta-data, list (## Danqing)
      - production-related information, process with flowchart (director selection by genre, PCA process) (## Danqing)
      - text analysis, describe process, justify process, fig of text analysis in 2D (## Zecai)
  - Comparing baseline models - accuracy barchart. (## Danqing) 
  - Tuning SVM, best SVM is final model for classical. Interpret the parameters for feature importance. (get_param) (## Danqing)
  
3. Deep learning (two pages)
  - processing poster data using array 
  - Models we tried, accuracy table: MLP1, MLP2, MLP3, VGG16, CNN (Zecai draws model structures, Wenshan describes models) 
  - Elaborate on our CNN model. Show a few filters (fig). 
  
4. Compare classical with deep learning. 

5. Conclusions
